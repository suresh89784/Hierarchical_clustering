# Hierarchical_clustering
Analysis and Prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of American mall markets called as Phonix mall To find out client requirements of dendrograms using scipy library with help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the No.of Linkages of clustering to predict.
# Problem Statement:
The American Finance market clients as per rate of GDP of 2011 found as growth in their market.

As a DataScience Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster use maximum linkage in upcomming future .
# Task:
with help of scipy library import library and dataset

using the Dendrogram find optimatl no.of Clusters.

Create a Hierarchy model =and visualize the cluster with matplotlib

# Conclusion:
According to model buildingas a engineer my prediction is cluster no.3 has highest no.of linkage.

# Insights:
1.Cluster 1 contains "red" which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Euclidean distances from the centroid up to Annual income approximate 139ks.

2.Cluster 2 contains "blue" shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Euclidean distances from the centroid up to Annual income approximate 79-80ks.

3.Cluster 3 contains "green" shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Euclidean distances from the centroid up to Annual income approximate 139ks.

4.Cluster 4 contains "cyan" shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Euclidean distances from the centroid up to Annual income approximate 40ks.

5.Cluster 5 contains "magnenta" shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum Euclidean distances from the centroid up to Annual income approximate 40ks.
